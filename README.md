# ALZHEIMER_DETECTION_APPLICATION
-Developed a high-performing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to accuratelydetect Alzheimer's disease using brain MRI scans.
- Trained the CNN model on a robust dataset of brain MRI scans, achieving an impressivedetection accuracy of 95.78%
- Created a user-friendly web application using Python and the Flask web framework
- Integrated the CNN model seamlessly into the web application using the Keras deeplearning library
- Empowered users to conveniently upload MRI scans and receive real-time predictions on the presence and stage of Alzheimer's disease.
